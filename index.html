        Platos methaphisical view of the world was all about the "eidos", an ethereal scenic entity he created with influences of the god's concepts that governed his culture, something that not even he couldnÂ´t escape. To put it in a few words he created a complex structure of ascending an object to divinity by abstracting it to what he called "perfection", "perfection" under his point of view existed but not in our "imperfect" realm, the imperfect realm or human realm was filled with all these imperfect objects that all had a common origin, the "perfect object" from the "perfect realm". an example of this is his own epistemological concept of "knowledge", that started in the most ordinary lines known to him as "Doxa", that is the common knowledge, common knowledge is something that can be relied on the falacy known as "ad popullum". by ascending or "rationalycing" this type of knowledge we go trough rational knowledge, mathematical knowlege, and we get to the "episteme", that is for him, the highest state of knowledge. Another example of this is his famous <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato#The_Cave">"alegory of the cave"</a>.
